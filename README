** ACTION
*****************************************************

The partition function is written as Z=\sum_{theta, phi) e^{-S}

S = - N J \sum_{x, mu>0} ( z_x^{dag} e^{i\theta_{x,mu} }z_{x+mu} +c.c.)
      + (K/2) \sum_{plaq} F^2
      + m^2/2 \sum_{x,mu>0} \theta_{x, \mu}^2

where F is the lattice field strenght

F_{\mu\nu}(x) = \theta_{\mu}(x) + \theta_{\nu}(x+mu) -\theta_{\mu}(x+\nu) -\theta_{\nu}(x)

Note that the photon mass term explictly breaks gauge invariance

C^* boundary conditions in all the directions are normally used, periodic b.c.
can be used by commenting the line
 
#define CSTAR_BC  

in include/macro.h Other macro that can be used are

DEBUG : several sanity checks are activated, which significantly slow-down the algorithm.

TEMPORAL_GAUGE : gauge fix theta_{x,0}=0 (this can be done only with C^* b.c.)

LORENZ_GAUGE : add (alpha/2)[\sum_{mu} \partial_{mu} theta_{mu}]^2 to the energy (alpha is defined inside conf_upd.c)

LINKS_FIXED_TO_ONE : fix all gauge fielsd theta to zero

** CONFIGURE PARAMETERS
*****************************************************

The value of N is fixed at configure time by the macro N_f so that to simulate
the CP^4 model one has to use 

./configure N_f=5

The following macro are availbale

N_f         the number of flavours (default 2)
ST_dim      spacetime dimensionality (default 2)

After the configuration, the compilation is performed as usual by
make


Calling the executable without input file the configuration options are shown
and the template file "template_input.in" is produced.


** INPUT FILE AND SOME CONVENTIONS
*****************************************************

A template input file is created when calling the executable without input file
and everything following # (up to carriage return) in the input file is
interpreted as a comment.
